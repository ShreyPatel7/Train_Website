                    <h3>Cylinder Steam Locomotive</h3>
                    
                <p>
                    The <b>cylinder</b> is the power-producing element of the steam engine powering a steam locomotive. The cylinder is made pressure-tight with end covers and a piston; a valve distributes the steam to the ends of the cylinder. Cylinders were cast in iron and later made of steel. The cylinder casting includes other features such as (in the case of the early Rocket locomotive) valve ports and mounting feet. The last big American locomotives incorporated the cylinders as part of huge one-piece steel castings that were the main frame of the locomotive. Renewable wearing surfaces were needed inside the cylinders and provided by cast-iron bushings.<br><br>
                    The way the valve controlled the steam entering and leaving the cylinder was known as steam distribution and shown by the shape of the indicator diagram. What happened to the steam inside the cylinder was assessed separately from what happened in the boiler and how much friction the moving machinery had to cope with. This assessment was known as "engine performance" or "cylinder performance". The cylinder performance, together with the boiler and machinery performance, established the efficiency of the complete locomotive. The pressure of the steam in the cylinder was measured as the piston moved and the power moving the piston was calculated and known as cylinder power. The forces produced in the cylinder moved the train but were also damaging to the structure which held the cylinders in place. Bolted joints came loose, cylinder castings and frames cracked and reduced the availability of the locomotive.<br>
                    <h4>Inside or outside cylinders</h4>
                    The front-mounted cylinders could be placed either inside (between the frames) or outside.<br><br>
                    A) Inside Cylinders<br>
                    B) Outside Cylinders <br><br>
                    In the 19th and early 20th centuries, inside cylinders were widely used in the United Kingdom, but outside cylinders were more common in Continental Europe and the United States. The reason for this difference is unclear. From about 1920, outside cylinders became more common in the UK but many inside-cylinder engines continued to be built. Inside cylinders give a more stable ride with less yaw or "nosing" but access for maintenance is more difficult. Some designers used inside cylinders for aesthetic reasons.<br><br>
                    <h4>Three or four cylinders</h4>
                    The demand for more power led to the development of engines with three cylinders (two outside and one inside) or four cylinders (two outside and two inside). Examples:<br>
                    A) Three cylinders, SR Class V, LNER Class A4, Merchant Navy class<br>
                    B) Four Cylinders, LMS Princess Royal Class, LMS Coronation Class, GWR Castle Class<br><br>
                    <h3>Valves</h3>
                    The valve chests or steam chests which contain the slide valves or piston valves may be located in various positions.<br>
                    <h4>Inside cylinders</h4>
                    If the cylinders are small, the valve chests may be located between the cylinders. For larger cylinders the valve chests are usually on top of the cylinders but, in early locomotives, they were sometimes underneath the cylinders.<br><br>
                    <h4>Outside cylinders</h4>
                    The valve chests are usually on top of the cylinders but, in older locomotives, the valve chests were sometimes located alongside the cylinders and inserted through slots in the frames. This meant that, while the cylinders were outside, the valves were inside and could be driven by inside valve gear.<br><br>
