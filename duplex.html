                    <h3>Duplex Steam Locomotives</h3>
                    <p>
                        A <b>duplex locomotive</b> is a steam locomotive that divides the driving force on its wheels by using two pairs of cylinders rigidly mounted to a single locomotive frame; it is not an articulated locomotive. The concept was first used in France in 1863, but was particularly developed in the early 1930s by the Baldwin Locomotive Works, the largest commercial builder of steam locomotives in North America, under the supervision of its then chief engineer, Ralph P. Johnson.<br><br>
                        Prior to this, the term duplex locomotive was sometimes applied to articulated locomotives in general.
                        <h4>The duplex solution</h4>
                        In Europe this problem was often overcome by dividing the drive between inside and outside cylinders, or else by using Articulated locomotives, although at the time it was not believed possible to run one stably at greater than 50 mph (80 km/h). American railroads proved to be unwilling to use locomotives with inside cylinders, so the problem of balance could not be solved by adding more cylinders per coupled wheel set. As locomotives got larger and more powerful, their reciprocating machinery had to get stronger and thus heavier, and thus the problems posed by imbalance and hammer blow became more severe. Speed also played a factor, since the forces became greater and more destructive at higher wheel speeds. Ralph P. Johnson thought that the growing size and piston thrusts of existing express passenger locomotives could not be sustained with the by-then conventional 4-8-4 two-cylinder layout. In addition, he became convinced that a single pair of cylinders with conventional valve gear and piston valves was approaching the limits in terms of steam flow.<br><br>
                        The earliest attempt at duplex locomotive was an 0-6-6-0 tank locomotive designed by Jules Petiet in 1863 for the French Northern Railway, but the idea was not perpetuated. However, the innovation of more rigid hinges that permitted only horizontal swinging movements and not twisting or vertical movement was from ALCO, and not seen until 1936's Union Pacific Challenger.<br><br>
                        Instead came the idea of having multiple groups of cylinders and driven wheels mounted in one rigid frame. A "duplex" version of a 4-8-4 would be a 4-4-4-4, with the eight driving wheels split into two groups of four, each with its own set of cylinders and valve gear. The reciprocating mass of both sets would be substantially less than the single set on the 4-8-4, since they would be under less stress and gentler piston thrusts. The cylinders could be smaller yet have larger, more efficient valves. The most obvious tradeoff was that, in Baldwin's proposed design, the rigid wheelbase was longer since the second set of cylinders had to be between the two sets of drivers. This was sufficiently concerning for many roads, for whom current locomotives were taxing enough, to reject the duplex idea.<br><br><br>
                        <h4>Baltimore and Ohio class N-1 #5600 George H. Emerson</h4>
                        The first road to use the idea was the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, which rejected a Baldwin proposal in 1932–33, but then constructed the single Baltimore and Ohio Class N-1, #5600 George H. Emerson in the railroad's own shops without Baldwin's assistance. The locomotive was completed in May 1937 and managed to retain the same coupled wheelbase as the road's current 4-8-2s by having the second set of cylinders reversed, mounted alongside the firebox, and driving the second set of coupled wheels forwards. This proved to be less than ideal, the size of the cylinders and firebox both being constrained by this location, the long steam passages proving problematic, and the cylinders suffering from the dust and heat of the nearby firebox.<br><br>
                        The locomotive was in light service and tested until withdrawal in 1943. It was not successful enough for the B&O to express any further interest.<br><br><br>
                        <h4>PRR class S1</h4>
                        The next usage of the duplex type was the Pennsylvania Railroad's single S1, designed to meet a requirement to operate a 1,200 short tons (1,070 long tons; 1,090 t) train at 100 mph (160 km/h) on level track and able to accelerate to that speed easily. In excess of 4,000 hp (3.0 MW) was necessary for that requirement, and to meet it Baldwin and the PRR created possibly the largest passenger steam locomotive ever built: a 6-4-4-6 locomotive 140 feet 2+1⁄2 inches (42.74 m) long and weighing 1,060,000 lb (480,000 kg) with tender. It was, in fact, too large to work over the majority of the PRR's system and was placed into service only between Chicago, Illinois and Crestline, Ohio (283 miles [455 km]). In service after December 1940, it proved powerful and capable but prone to wheelslip and surging, presaging the problems with later duplex designs. By and large, its flaws were written-off as simply the teething troubles of an early, first-cut prototype. It was taken out of service in 1946. This locomotive got the nickname "The Big Engine"
