            <h2>Enhance Your Knowledge On Steam Locomotive</h2>
            <p>A steam locomotive is a locomotive that provides the force to move itself and other vehicles by means of the
                expansion of steam.It is fuelled by burning combustible material to heat water in the locomotive's boiler to
                the point where it becomes gaseous and its volume increases 1,700 times. Functionally, it is a steam engine
                on wheels.</p>

            <p>Origin of steam locomotives were Britain, United States and Continental Europe</p>

                    <h3>Britain</h3>
                    <p>In 1784, William Murdoch, a Scottish inventor, built a small-scale prototype of a steam road
                        locomotive in Birmingham. The first full-scale working railway steam locomotive was the 3 ft (914
                        mm) gauge Coalbrookdale Locomotive, built by Trevithick in 1802. It was constructed for the
                        Coalbrookdale ironworks in Shropshire in the United Kingdom though no record of it working there has
                        survived. On 21 February 1804, the first recorded steam-hauled railway journey took place as another
                        of Trevithick's locomotives hauled a train along the 4 ft 4 in (1,321 mm)-wide tramway from the
                        Pen-y-darren ironworks, near Merthyr Tydfil, to Abercynon in South Wales.</p>

                    <h3>United States</h3>
                    <p>Many of the earliest locomotives for commercial use on American railroads were imported from Great
                        Britain, including first the Stourbridge Lion and later the John Bull. In 1830, the Baltimore and
                        Ohio Railroad's Tom Thumb, designed by Peter Cooper, was the first commercial US-built locomotive to
                        run in America; it was intended as a demonstration of the potential of steam traction rather than as
                        a revenue-earning locomotive. As of 2021, the original John Bull was on static display in the
                        National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C. The replica is preserved at the Railroad
                        Museum of Pennsylvania.</p>

                    <h3>Continental Europe</h3>
                    <p>The first steam locomotive in service in Europe was named The Elephant, which on 5 May 1835 hauled a
                        train on the first line in Belgium, linking Mechelen and Brussels. In Germany, the first working
                        steam locomotive was a rack-and-pinion engine, similar to the Salamanca, designed by the British
                        locomotive pioneer John Blenkinsop. Built in June 1816 by Johann Friedrich Krigar in the Royal
                        Berlin Iron Foundry, the locomotive ran on a circular track in the factory yard. On 7 December 1835,
                        the Adler ran for the first time between Nuremberg and Fürth on the Bavarian Ludwig Railway. It was
                        the 118th engine from the locomotive works of Robert Stephenson and stood under patent protection.

                practice (shown as US+).</p>

                    <h6>Boiler</h6>
                    <p>A boiler consists of a firebox where the fuel is burned, a barrel where water is turned into steam
                        and a smokebox which is kept at a slightly lower pressure than outside the firebox.The fire-tube
                        boiler has internal tubes connecting the firebox to the smokebox through which the combustion gases
                        flow transferring heat to the water. All the tubes together provide a large contact area, called the
                        tube heating surface, between the gas and water in the boiler. Boiler water surrounds the firebox to
                        stop the metal from becoming too hot. This is another area where the gas transfers heat to the water
                        and is called the firebox heating surface. Ash and char collect in the smokebox as the gas gets
                        drawn up the chimney by the exhaust steam from the cylinders.The exhaust steam from the engine
                        cylinders shoots out of a nozzle pointing up the chimney in the smokebox. The steam entrains or
                        drags the smokebox gases with it which maintains a lower pressure in the smokebox than that under
                        the firebox grate. This pressure difference causes air to flow up through the coal bed and keeps the
                        fire burning.</p>

                    <img src="image/Steam_locomotive_work.gif" alt="running gear" height="120px">
                    <h6>Running Gear</h6>
                    <p>Running gear includes the brake gear, wheel sets, axleboxes, springing and the motion that includes
                        connecting rods and valve gear. The transmission of the power from the pistons to the rails and the
                        behaviour of the locomotive as a vehicle, being able to negotiate curves, points and irregularities
                        in the track, is of paramount importance. Because reciprocating power has to be directly applied to
                        the rail from 0 rpm upwards, this creates the problem of adhesion of the driving wheels to the
                        smooth rail surface. Adhesive weight is the portion of the locomotive's weight bearing on the
                        driving wheels. This is made more effective if a pair of driving wheels is able to make the most of
                        its axle load, i.e. its individual share of the adhesive weight.Railroads generally preferred
                        locomotives with fewer axles, to reduce maintenance costs. The number of axles required was dictated
                        by the maximum axle loading of the railroad in question. A builder would typically add axles until
                        the maximum weight on any one axle was acceptable to the railroad's maximum axle loading.</p>

                    <img src="image/steam-engine.gif" alt="enginework" height="120px">
                    <h6>Steam Circuit</h6>
                    <p>The steam generated in the boiler fills the space above the water in the partially filled boiler. Its
                        maximum working pressure is limited by spring-loaded safety valves. It is then collected either in a
                        perforated tube fitted above the water level or by a dome that often houses the regulator valve, or
                        throttle, the purpose of which is to control the amount of steam leaving the boiler. The cylinders
                        are double-acting, with steam admitted to each side of the piston in turn. In a two-cylinder
                        locomotive, one cylinder is located on each side of the vehicle. The cranks are set 90° out of
                        phase. During a full rotation of the driving wheel, steam provides four power strokes; each cylinder
                        receives two injections of steam per revolution. Note that at the two "dead centres", when the
                        connecting rod is on the same axis as the crankpin on the driving wheel, the connecting rod applies
                        no torque to the wheel. Therefore, if both cranksets could be at "dead centre" at the same time, and
                        the wheels should happen to stop in this position, the locomotive could not start moving.</p>

                    <h6>Fuel And water</h6>
                    <p>Generally, the largest locomotives are permanently coupled to a tender that carries the water and
                        fuel. Often, locomotives working shorter distances do not have a tender and carry the fuel in a
                        bunker, with the water carried in tanks placed next to the boiler. The tanks can be in various
                        configurations, including two tanks alongside (side tanks or pannier tanks), one on top (saddle
                        tank) or one between the frames (well tank). Railways serving sugar cane farming operations burned
                        bagasse, a byproduct of sugar refining. In the US, the ready availability and low price of oil made
                        it a popular steam locomotive fuel after 1900 for the southwestern railroads, particularly the
                        Southern Pacific. In the Australian state of Victoria, many steam locomotives were converted to
                        heavy oil firing after World War II. German, Russian, Australian and British railways experimented
                        with using coal dust to fire locomotives.A number of tourist lines and heritage locomotives in
                        Switzerland, Argentina and Australia have used light diesel-type oil. </p>
